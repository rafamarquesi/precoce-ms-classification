# Project carried out in the master's program in applied computing at FACOM/UFMS, at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. For more information, [visit here](https://www.facom.ufms.br/mestradoprofissional/).

The general objective of this work is to evaluate which machine learning algorithm performs better in the most current dataset of the Precoce MS program and, then, to build a classification model to predict the carcass quality of the animals to be slaughtered, given parameters provided by the producer. The model will support beef cattle producers in decision-making, mitigate the risks of failure in regions where there is greater need, support public policies and production incentives, aiming to increase the quality of the meat produced.

# Precoce MS

The Precoce MS program was developed to stimulate the production of quality meat in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. This program was established in Decree N° 14,526, of July 28, 2016, in conjunction with SEFAZ/SEPAF Resolution N° 69 of August 30, 2016. In this program, the producer can receive a tax incentive equivalent to a maximum of 67 % of ICMS collected, using techniques that contribute to the production of animals with superior carcass quality. For concession, the following dimensions are evaluated: the production process, the product obtained and the standardization of the batch, where 30% of the incentive to be paid to the producer results from the production process dimension and 70% of the incentive results from the product dimension obtained.

# Database

The most current database of the Precoce MS program was made available by a representative of Embrapa Gado de Corte.

# Machine Learning

The present project aims to use Data Mining techniques, supported by the supervised machine learning area, in order to apply algorithms for classification of a target class, from different paradigms, namely, <em>k</em>-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine.

# Requirements

- For the development, we used the Python 3.8.10.
- The libraries used in the project are listed in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/rafamarquesi/precoce-ms-classification/blob/master/requirements.txt).

The libraries need some dependencies to work well. For Linux based systems, you can install them using the following command:

```apt install chromium-chromedriver```
